            <h2>Interests</h2>
<p class="sum">
            I love television and films and I try to find some sort of inspiration in the films I watch.
            I used to call, what I considered, profound and meaningful moments in my life <i>Movie Moments</i> and I use these thoughts in my art.
              Movies are like adventures where anything and everything is possible.
              So when I think artistically and creatively, I see everything in new and interesting ways.
<p class="sum">
               From zany cartoons to intense action or horror sequences, I see something creative and surreal that I can create.
                For example, I can image monkeys jumping up and down on a teacher's desk  or cupcake monsters taking over my notebooks.
                 I use these thoughts as inspiration.  I see something creative or humorous in almost everything.
                 I used my imagination to create funny stories.
                  Just picturing what could be created and how funny things would look like when I image my art.
                  This is when art is most interesting to me.
